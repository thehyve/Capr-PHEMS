\title{Count Occurrences of Concept IDs in OMOP Database}
\usage{
countOccurrences(
  db_connection,
  cdm_schema,
  vocab_schema,
  v,
  tables,
  links,
  save_path
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db_connection}{A database connection object through which queries will be executed.}

\item{cdm_schema}{The database cdm_schema in which the tables are located.}

\item{vocab_schema}{The database vocab_schema in which the concept tables are located.}

\item{v}{A vector of concept_ids to count occurrences for.}

\item{tables}{A character vector of CDM table names to search within.}

\item{links}{A list linking each table to its respective concept_id field.}

\item{save_path}{The path to save the results to as a CSV file. If NULL, the results are not saved.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns for the number of times any concept from 'v' occurs: direct count of persons,
        direct count of records, descendant count of persons, and descendant count of records.
        The tibble also includes the concept names and domain ids derived from `v` and is arranged by the total
        record count (direct + descendant).
}
\description{
This function counts the occurrences of specified concept IDs within specified tables in an OMOP database,
including direct occurrences and occurrences through descendants, based on a provided cdm_schema and links.
It returns a tibble summarizing the counts across persons and across records.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `db_connection` is a valid database connection, `cdm_schema` is set to "public",
# `tables` contains the names of the tables to search, `links` defines the relevant fields,
# and `v` contains the values to search for:
results <- countOccurrences(
  db_connection = db_connection, cdm_schema = "public", vocab_schema = "vocabulary",
  v = c(1, 2), tables = c("observation", "condition_occurrence"),
  links = list(observation = "observation_concept_id", condition_occurrence = "condition_concept_id"),
  save_path = NULL
)

}
