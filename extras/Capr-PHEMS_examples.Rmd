## Set-up
```{r knitr, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# knitr::purl(
#   input = './inst/templates/cohortCapr_examples.Rmd',
#   output = './inst/templates/cohortCapr.R'
# )
```

## Set-up config
```{r Get project configurations}
connectionConfig <- config::get(config = 'config', file = './inst/config/connection_config.yml')
config_oth <- config::get(config = 'config', file = './inst/config/config.yml')
```

## Load libraries
```{r Load libraries}
library(RSQLite)
library(tibble)
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(CohortGenerator)
library(CirceR)
library(Capr)
```

## Create connection details
Here we specify our connection details. In this case, we use a yml configuration file
to specify our connection details. Alternatively, strings may be used directly to assign
the function arguments. These details will allow us to connect to the DB / OMOP CDM instance.
```{r connect to database, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
#  Use connection details from configuration
connectionDetails <- createConnectionDetails(
  dbms = connectionConfig$dbms,
  user = connectionConfig$user,
  password = connectionConfig$password,
  server = connectionConfig$server,
  port = connectionConfig$port,
  oracleDriver = connectionConfig$oracleDriver,
  pathToDriver = connectionConfig$pathToDriver
)
```

## Concept sets
Concept sets have been defined per use case in ./R/conceptSets.R.
Here we collect the details for all concept ids in all created concept sets 
using the Capr::getConceptSetDetails() function. This can only be done for
concepts that exist within the concept set; not for descendants of these concepts.
This function can be applied to any concept set and returns the concept_name,
standardness, the domain, the source vocabulary and code, and more.
```{r concept sets, echo=TRUE}
## Concept sets
data(conceptSets)

# Establish connection
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

conceptSets$conceptSets <- conceptSets$conceptSets %>%
  # Add details for all concepts (excl. descendants)
  lapply(FUN = Capr::getConceptSetDetails,
         con = con,
         vocabularyDatabaseSchema = connectionConfig$vocabulary_schema)

# Disconnect
disconnect(con)
```

## Concept counts
Retrieve counts for all concepts in a concept set.
Return the counts on the person (1) and record (2) level for each concept expli-
citly in the concept set and on the person (3) and record (4) level including
all descendants of concepts in the conceptSet.
```{r count occurences}
## Count occurrences of each concept in data
# Establish connection
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# Get countOccurrences function
source("./R/countOccurrences.R")

# Get links between tables and fields as input
source("./R/table_linked_to_concept_field.R")

uc1Counts <-
  countOccurrences(
    v = conceptSets$concepts$uc1,
    tables = names(links), # Query all CDM tables
    links = links, # Links between tables and concept_id fields (cdm_table:field)
    db_connection = con,
    cdm_schema = connectionConfig$cdm_schema,
    vocab_schema = connectionConfig$vocabulary_schema,
    save_path = config_oth$save_path_counts
  ) %>% print()

# Disconnect
disconnect(con)
```

## Standard and non-standard concepts given a database connection
The isStandardDB function checks for every concept used in a CDM instance whether it is standard or not. It works by joining the CDM tables to the concept table in the vocabulary schema on the concept_id. The function returns a table of non-standard concepts.
```{r Standardness check DB}
# Connect to DB
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# Return table of non-standard concepts
source('./R/isStandardDB.R')
nonStandardDB <- isStandardDB(
  db_connection = con,
  cdm_schema = connectionConfig$cdm_schema,
  vocab_schema = connectionConfig$vocabulary_schema,
  links = links, # Links between tables and concept_id fields (cdm_table:field)
  save_path = config_oth$save_path_isStandard
) %>% print()
```

## Standard and non-standard concepts given a list of concept IDs
To check for each concept in a list of concept_ids and source codes, the "isStandard.R" function is used. This function takes as input a list of concept_ids and source codes and returns a table of non-standard concepts. Saved results include all concepts regardless
of standardness.
See inst/extdata/phems-variable-list for examples of CSVs tables in the expected format.
```{r Standard non-standard check}
# Connect to DB
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# Return table of non-standard concepts
source('./R/isStandard.R')
nonStandard <- isStandard(
  db_connection = con,
  data_concepts_path = config_oth$concepts_path,
  vocab_schema = connectionConfig$vocabulary_schema,
  # (optional) Save the results (with standard and non-standard concepts)
  save_path = config_oth$save_path_isStandard
)

# Disconnect
disconnect(con)

# Print all non-standard concepts
nonStandard

```

## Standard and non-standard concepts given a concept set
Similarly to isStandard(), isStandardCS() can be used to check the standardness of concepts, but rather given a concept set than a list. The function returns a table of non-standard concepts. Saved results include all concepts regardless of standardness.
```{r Standard non-standard check concept set}
# connect to DB
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# run for uc2 conceptSet
uc2 <- conceptSets$conceptSets$uc2

# check standardness across concept set
source('./R/isStandardCS.R')
nonStandardCS <- isStandardCS(
  conceptSet = conceptSets$conceptSets$uc2,
  # (optional) Save the results (with standard and non-standard concepts)
  save_path = config_oth$save_path_isStandard
)

# Disconnect
disconnect(con)

# print results (non-standard)
nonStandardCS
```

## Initial event cohort
NOTE: the cohort defined in this chunk serves solely as an example.
Here we define a cohort for UC1.
```{r Cohort definition}
## Cohort definition
# Create cohort definition
ch <- cohort(
  entry = entry(
    # enter patients with conditions that would be in UC1
    conditionOccurrence(conceptSets$conceptSets$uc1),
    observationWindow = continuousObservation(0, 0),
    primaryCriteriaLimit = "All"
  ),
  attrition = attrition(
    # keep patients with all criteria matched:
    withAll(
      # criteria 1 is defined by this withAny clause:
      # keep patients with any of the following:
      withAny(
        # include patients with at least 1 cardiac complication...
        atLeast(
          x = 1,
          # with cardiac complications represented by condition concepts and...
          query = conditionOccurrence(conceptSets$conceptSets$cardiacComplications)
        ),
        atLeast(
          x = 1,
          # with cardiac complications represented by procedure concepts.
          query = procedure(conceptSets$conceptSets$cardiacComplications)
        )
      ),
      # criteria 2 is defined by the second withAny clause:
      # include patients who have had at least 1 laboratory measurement
      withAny(
        atLeast(
          x = 1,
          query = measurement(conceptSets$conceptSets$labTests)
        )
      )
    )
  ),
  # end of cohort at end of observation period
  exit = exit(
    endStrategy = observationExit()
  )
)
```

## Write json expressions and sql queries
json expressions can be used to save the cohort definitions and to generate SQL queries
```{r json and sql}
## Cohort json and sql
# Generate json for cohort
chJson <- ch %>%
  Capr::toCirce() %>%
  jsonlite::toJSON(pretty = TRUE, auto_unbox = TRUE) %>%
  as.character()

# Generate cohort sql query
sql <- CirceR::buildCohortQuery(
  expression = CirceR::cohortExpressionFromJson(chJson),
  options = CirceR::createGenerateOptions(generateStats = FALSE)
)
```

## Save cohort and concept set jsons
Save the cohort and concept set jsons; these can be imported into ATLAS
```{r Save cohort and concept set json}
write(chJson, paste0(config_oth$save_path_json, "/cohort.json"))
for (cs in names(conceptSets$conceptSets)) {
  writeConceptSet(
    x = conceptSets$conceptSets[[cs]],
    path = paste(config_oth$save_path_json, "/", cs, "_cs.json", sep="")
  )
}
```

## Query the cohorts using the SQL query
```{r Create and generate cohorts}
# Establish connection
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# Cohorts to create
cohortsToCreate <- tibble::tibble(
  cohortId = 9876,
  cohortName = "cohort",
  sql = sql
)

# Cohort tables
cohortTableNames <- CohortGenerator::getCohortTableNames(cohortTable = "cohort")
CohortGenerator::createCohortTables(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "cohort",
  cohortTableNames = cohortTableNames
)

# Generate the cohorts
cohortsGenerated <- CohortGenerator::generateCohortSet(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cdmDatabaseSchema = "cdm",
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "cohort",
  cohortTableNames = cohortTableNames,
  cohortDefinitionSet = cohortsToCreate
)

# Get cohort counts
cohortCounts <- CohortGenerator::getCohortCounts(
  connectionDetails = connectionDetails,
  cohortDatabaseSchema = "cohort",
  cohortTable = cohortTableNames$cohortTable
)

# Disconnect
disconnect(con)
```

## Number of people in db
```{r Number of people in DB}
# Establish connection
con <- connect(connectionDetails)

# Count unique person_id in the person table
query_person <- 
  paste0("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT person_id) AS num_persons FROM ", connectionConfig$cdm_schema, ".person")
result_person <- dbGetQuery(con, query_person)$num_persons

# Count unique subject_id in the cardiac_arrest table
query_cohort <-   
  paste0("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS num_persons FROM ", connectionConfig$cohort_schema, ".cohort")

result_cohort <- dbGetQuery(con, query_cohort)$num_persons

# Print results
cat("Number of persons in dataset: ", result_person, "\n")
cat("Number of persons in cohort: ", result_cohort, "\n")


# Disconnect
disconnect(con)
```
